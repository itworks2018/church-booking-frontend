This code defines an admin login page for a church booking system with a styled user interface and authentication logic. The UI features a full-page background image and a glassmorphism-styled login form built with Tailwind CSS. The form includes input fields for admin email and password, a submit button, and a link for non-admin users to navigate to the regular user login page.

Functionally, the form submission is handled by preventing the default action, capturing input values, and sending them via a POST request to a backend authentication API. The code verifies that the entered email matches a predefined admin email to enforce admin-only access. Upon successful authentication and authorization, it stores the JWT token and email in local storage and redirects the user to the admin dashboard. In case of login failure, unauthorized access, or network errors, appropriate alert messages are displayed to inform the user.
