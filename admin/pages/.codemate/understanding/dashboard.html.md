This code defines a dashboard overview interface with two main sections:

1. **Metrics Summary**: A responsive grid displaying four key metrics related to bookings and members:
   - Booking Reservations
   - Pending Approval
   - Upcoming Events
   - Total Members
   Each metric is styled with distinct background colors, white text, and includes a heading and a numeric value initialized to zero, with unique IDs for dynamic updates.

2. **Pending Booking Requests Table**: A table listing pending booking requests with columns for Event Name, User, Venue, Date, and Status. The table header is styled for light and dark modes, and the table body is empty with an ID for dynamically inserting rows representing individual pending requests.
