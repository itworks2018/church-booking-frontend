This code implements a dashboard overview section for a booking or event management application. It features a prominent header and a responsive grid displaying four key metrics—Booking Reservations, Pending Approval, Upcoming Events, and Total Members—each with distinct background colors and numeric counts initialized to zero for clear visibility. Below the metrics, there is a table titled "Pending Booking Requests" designed to list booking requests awaiting approval, with columns for Event Name, User, Venue, Date, and Status. The table body starts empty and is intended for dynamic data insertion. The entire layout is styled using utility-first CSS classes to ensure proper spacing, responsiveness, and support for dark mode.
