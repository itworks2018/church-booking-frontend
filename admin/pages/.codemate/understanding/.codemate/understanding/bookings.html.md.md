This code implements a styled, responsive HTML form for event creation. It includes fields for entering the event name, purpose, expected number of attendees, selecting a venue from predefined options, specifying start and end date/time, and providing additional instructions or descriptions. Each input element is consistently styled with padding, borders, rounded corners, and focus effects to enhance usability and aesthetics. The form layout adapts responsively, displaying the start and end date/time inputs side-by-side on medium and larger screens. The form concludes with a prominently styled submit button labeled "Submit Event" to finalize the event submission.
