This is a binary file containing an ICC color profile embedded within a JPEG image. The file includes metadata and color management information used to ensure consistent color representation across different devices and platforms. The ICC profile specifies color spaces, white points, gamma curves, and other color characteristics for accurate color rendering. The data is structured according to the ICC specification and is embedded in the JPEG using the APP2 marker segment with the "ICC_PROFILE" identifier. This profile helps applications interpret the image's color data correctly.
