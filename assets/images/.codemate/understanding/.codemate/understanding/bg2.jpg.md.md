This code is a complete binary representation of a JPEG image file. It includes all standard JPEG components such as the Start of Image (SOI) marker, application-specific metadata segments (APP markers) containing JFIF header, ICC color profile, and EXIF metadata describing image properties. The file also defines quantization tables (DQT) and Huffman tables (DHT) essential for JPEG compression. The Start of Frame (SOF) and Start of Scan (SOS) markers delineate the image frame and compressed pixel data, respectively. Finally, the file concludes with the End of Image (EOI) marker. Together, these elements form a fully encoded JPEG image with embedded color management and descriptive metadata.
