This CSS stylesheet defines the visual design for a modern, user-friendly web interface focused on booking and authentication functionalities. It includes:

- **Global Reset and Base Styling**: Normalizes element spacing and box sizing, sets a clean sans-serif font, light background, and readable text styles for the entire page.

- **Content Container**: Centers the main content with a maximum width, padding, white background, rounded corners, and subtle shadow for a card-like appearance.

- **Topbar/Header**: Uses flexbox to space header elements, styles the main heading with a distinct blue color and bold font, and designs a prominent red logout button with hover effects.

- **Form Elements**: Provides consistent spacing and styling for labels, inputs, selects, textareas, and buttons, emphasizing usability with full-width inputs, clear labels, rounded corners, and interactive button states.

- **Authentication Tabs**: Implements a horizontal tab navigation with spacing, rounded corners, and distinct styling for active tabs to guide user interaction.

- **Message Boxes**: Styles success and error messages with color-coded backgrounds and text, padding, and rounded corners to clearly communicate status feedback.

- **Bookings List**: Organizes booking entries by day with light backgrounds and padding; individual bookings have white backgrounds, padding, rounded corners, margin, subtle shadows, and a colored left border indicating booking status (pending, approved, rejected, canceled).

- **Responsive Adjustments**: Enhances usability on smaller screens by adjusting container spacing, stacking the topbar vertically with spacing, and slightly reducing font sizes for buttons and headings.

Overall, the stylesheet ensures a clean, accessible, and visually coherent interface optimized for booking management and user authentication workflows across devices.
