This code implements a responsive announcement carousel section for a webpage. It features:

- A titled section labeled "Announcements" styled with Tailwind CSS for layout, typography, and dark mode support.
- A horizontal carousel containing three announcement slides, each with a heading and descriptive text.
- Navigation buttons ("‹" and "›") positioned over the carousel to allow users to cycle through the announcements.
- JavaScript logic to handle the carousel functionality by translating the slides container horizontally based on the current slide index, enabling seamless cycling forward and backward through the announcements.
