This code defines a responsive section titled "Meet the Pastors & Ministries" designed to showcase three pastors and their respective ministries. The section is styled with padding and centered within a maximum width container. Inside, a grid layout adapts from a single column on small screens to three columns on medium and larger screens. Each pastor is presented in a card featuring a circular profile image, their name in bold text, and their ministry role, with styling that supports both light and dark themes for background and text colors. The overall design emphasizes clarity, accessibility, and visual appeal.
