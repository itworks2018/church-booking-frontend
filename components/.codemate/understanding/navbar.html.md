This code defines a reusable responsive navigation bar component for a website called "CCF Sandoval Events." 

Key features include:
- A logo linking to the homepage.
- Desktop navigation with "Log In" and "Sign Up" buttons styled with Tailwind CSS classes.
- A mobile menu button (hamburger icon) that toggles the visibility of a dropdown menu containing the same "Log In" and "Sign Up" links.
- Responsive design: the desktop menu is hidden on small screens, while the mobile menu button and dropdown appear only on smaller devices.
- A small JavaScript snippet handles toggling the mobile dropdown menu's visibility when the mobile menu button is clicked.
- Dark mode support through conditional Tailwind CSS classes for background and text colors.
