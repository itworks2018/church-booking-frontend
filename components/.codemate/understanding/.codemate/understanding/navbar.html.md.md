This code implements a responsive navigation bar component for the "CCF Sandoval Events" website. It features a logo that links to the homepage and adapts its appearance for light and dark modes. On medium and larger screens, a horizontal desktop menu displays "Log In" and "Sign Up" buttons with interactive hover styles. For smaller screens, a hamburger menu button toggles a dropdown mobile menu containing the same navigation links, ensuring consistent styling across devices. The toggle functionality is managed via JavaScript by adding or removing a "hidden" class to show or hide the mobile menu. The component uses utility-first CSS classes (such as Tailwind CSS) to handle layout, spacing, colors, responsiveness, and dark mode support.
