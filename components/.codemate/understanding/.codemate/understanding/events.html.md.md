This code implements an "Events" section for a webpage using Tailwind CSS, featuring a responsive two-column grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes. The section is centered with padding and supports dark mode styling.

- The **Upcoming Events** column spans two-thirds of the grid on medium and larger screens. It includes a heading and a list of upcoming events, each displaying the event title, date/time, and venue information. Currently, it lists one event: "Sunday Worship Service" on March 5, 2024, at 7:00 PM in the Main Hall.

- The **Regular Events** column occupies one-third of the grid on medium and larger screens. It contains a heading and a list of recurring events, each showing the event title and schedule. Currently, it features one event: "Discipleship Group" every Wednesday from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM.

The layout stacks vertically on smaller screens and arranges side-by-side on medium and larger screens, ensuring responsiveness. Dark mode support adjusts text and background colors for better readability in different themes.
