This code implements a responsive "Meet the Pastors & Ministries" section that highlights three pastors along with their ministries. It uses a centered container with padding and a maximum width to ensure proper spacing and alignment. The content is arranged in a grid layout that adapts to screen size, displaying three cards side-by-side on medium and larger devices, and stacking them vertically on smaller screens. Each card includes a circular portrait image, the pastor's name in bold, and their ministry role, with styling that supports both light and dark modes for backgrounds and text. The design focuses on clarity, accessibility, and an appealing visual presentation.
