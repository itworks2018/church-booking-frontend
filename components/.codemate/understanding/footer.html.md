This code defines a reusable website footer component styled with Tailwind CSS. The footer has a dark background and light text, and it is structured into three columns on medium and larger screens (stacked on smaller screens). The columns provide:

1. Location details for "CCF Sandoval" including address information.
2. Service times listing Sunday worship and midweek service schedules.
3. Contact information including an email address and phone number.

At the bottom, there is a centered copyright notice for the year 2025. The layout is responsive and visually separated with padding and margin spacing.
