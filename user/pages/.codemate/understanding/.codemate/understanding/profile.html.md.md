This code implements a styled user profile form component featuring a container with adaptive background colors for light and dark modes, rounded corners, shadow effects, and padding. It includes a heading labeled "My Profile" and a form with four input fields: Full Name, Email (disabled for editing), Contact Number, and Church Role. Each input field is styled for full width with padding, borders, and rounded corners. The form concludes with a prominently styled blue "Save Changes" button with white text and rounded corners. The overall layout uses vertical spacing between elements to enhance clarity and readability.
