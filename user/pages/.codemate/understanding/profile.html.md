This code defines a styled user profile form component with a white background that adapts to dark mode. It includes a heading titled "My Profile" and a form containing input fields for Full Name, Email (which is disabled and not editable), Contact Number, and Church Role. Each input is styled with padding, borders, and rounded corners. At the bottom, there is a blue "Save Changes" button for submitting the form. The layout uses spacing between elements and shadow effects for visual depth.
