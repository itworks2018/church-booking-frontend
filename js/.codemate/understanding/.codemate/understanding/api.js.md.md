This code offers utility functions to handle user authentication and facilitate API communication with a backend service. It sets a base API URL and manages authentication state by storing and retrieving an access token and user role in localStorage. The code includes functions to set, get, and clear authentication data both in memory and persistent storage. Additionally, it provides an asynchronous function to perform HTTP requests to the API, automatically attaching necessary headers such as JSON content type and authorization token when available. The function also processes JSON responses and implements error handling by throwing exceptions for unsuccessful responses.
