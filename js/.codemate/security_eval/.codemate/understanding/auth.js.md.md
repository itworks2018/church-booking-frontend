The code provides client-side functionality for user signup and login processes, including form handling, sending user credentials to backend APIs, and redirecting users based on their roles. Key operations include capturing user inputs (name, email, password), making asynchronous requests to authentication endpoints, storing authentication tokens and roles, and toggling visibility between login and signup forms.

However, the implementation lacks critical security features such as input validation and sanitization, secure password handling, CSRF protection, safe error message display, and secure token storage. Role-based access control is enforced only on the client side, which is insufficient for security. Additionally, there is no indication of rate limiting or brute force attack mitigation. The UI manipulation for form visibility does not address accessibility concerns.

Overall, while functional for basic authentication flows, the code requires significant enhancements in security practices and should be complemented by robust server-side protections and secure communication protocols.
